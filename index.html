    <h1>My Favorite Hobby:-</h1>

        <p>My favorite hobby is reading. Reading is the action or skill of reading written or printed matter silently or aloud. Reading is a good habit because it improves memory and cognitive ability â€” which means it's a healthy habit that can help kids inside and outside the classroom. Along with that improved brain power comes an improved vocabulary. Furthermore reading helps decrease the stress level and improve writing skills. Reading is one of the most important and beneficial activities. If you have ever read a book in life you will know the pleasure and rewards of reading. Reading is the kind of exercise that keeps your mind engaged, active and healthy. It is important to develop the habit of reading not only for the sake of knowledge but also for personal growth and development. It develops positive thinking and gives you a better perspective of life. Reading enhances your knowledge, improves your concentration and makes you more confident and debate ready. The more you read the more wise you become and the more you will be recognized and appreciated.<p>
